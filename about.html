        My name is <strong>Kristine Elle Benjamin</strong>. I grew up in a small town called Kinarut,
        tucked away in <i>Sabah, Malaysia</i>. I’m currently studying Computer Science (Graphics and Multimedia Software) at UTM.
        Since I was young, I’ve always had a creative side and dreamed of building my own website. That dream led me
        to web development, where I enjoy creating responsive and user-friendly sites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        Taking this subject at UTM has been an exciting journey of turning my ideas into real projects.

        I love drawing, listening to music, and getting plenty of good nap. I’m naturally a bit introverted and quiet at first,
        but once you get to know me, I am always up for a good laugh. I enjoy spending time being creative and relaxing, and I’m
        always curious to learn new things and meet interesting people along the way.
